# Final Project

For the capstone project for this course, you will build a simple website. The subject matter can be anything you like. It must consist of multiple pages, all linked together using a navigation bar of some sort. It must use CSS to style everything and it must include appropriate use of html organizing elements.

## Project Requirements

* Must consist of at least three distinct pages (3 html files)
* All pages must be linked together with some dedicated navigation
* All pages must be styled with an external CSS stylesheet (you may want to use the same CSS file for all pages)
* All content must be specified by appropriate semantic HTML elements.
* You should include an image on at least two of the pages, but all of them would be nice.
* You should try to have fun with this. Be as creative as you wish.

## HTML elements

* You must use at least one `<ol>` or `<ul>` element
* You must use at least one `<table>` element or use divs with table layout css styling (see chapter 5)
* You must use html organizing container elements such as `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<heading>` to define various sections of your content.
* You must use links `<a>` elements to link all pages together, and should consider using external links to other web pages to add some further content.
* You must pay at least some homage to ADA compliance and search engine optimization. That is, all `<img>` tags should include `alt` attributes and you should have appropriate `<meta>` tags in your `<head>` element.

## Considerations

This should be a culmination of everything you have studied. It should be a fun way to show off some of the things that you have learned. You are given absolute discretion when it comes to subject matter, but keep it tasteful.

A few ideas:

* A family website
* A business
* A hobby
* A portfolio to show off some work you've done
* An informational site dedicated to some subject that you are knowledgable about

You have until the last day of finals week to complete this project. *Please ask questions!* Think about what you want something to look like and I can help you develop the CSS necessary to accomplish it. If necessary, draw it out on paper and we can work through the details in code in class. For finals week, I will be available at all of our normal class times and you may choose to attend or not, but it might be a good idea to come and we can workshop everything that you're working on.

When you are finished, simply push your work back to this repository.
